Subject: [PATCH 02/15] match.pd: Remove commented out line pragmas unless -vv
 is used.

genmatch currently outputs commented out line directives that have no effect
but the compiler still has to parse only to discard.

They are however handy when debugging genmatch output.  As such this moves them
behind the -vv flag.

gcc/ChangeLog:

	PR bootstrap/84402
	* genmatch.cc (output_line_directive): Only emit commented directive
	when -vv.

(cherry picked from commit e487fcc0f7466ea663a0fea52076337bebd42b8b)
