Subject: [PATCH] Fix calling libarchive's tar

https://bugs.gentoo.org/886447

Very similar to 33_all_msgfmt-libstdc++-link.patch, whose description is:
"""
Ensure that msgfmt doesn't encounter problems during gcc bootstrapping.

Solves error messages like the following:

msgfmt: /var/tmp/portage/sys-devel/gcc-4.1.2/work/build/./gcc/libgcc_s.so.1: version `GCC_4.2.0' not found (required by /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.5.3/libstdc++.so.6)

The libgcc_s.so used during build doesn't satisfy the needs of the
libstdc++.so that msgfmt is linked against. On the other hand, msgfmt
is used as a stand-alone application here, and what library it uses
behind the scenes is of no concern to the gcc build process.
Therefore, simply invoking it "as usual", i.e. without any special
library path, will make it work as expected here.
